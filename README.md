# Usage

## Install

Install with composer

    composer require simplesamlphp/simplesamlphp-module-adfs


## Configuration

View samples in `metadata-templates` for defining your idp and any relying parties/sps.

In `config.php` you'll need to set `'enable.adfs-idp' => true` and enabled the module.

### Tips for admins new to WS-Fed

* A `realm` is similar to an entityId from SAML. `adfs-sp-remote.php` metadata 
 array is based on `realm`. An IP STS is similar to an IdP.
* Some WS-Fed Relying Party applications want the assertion lifetime to be longer
 than the application's session lifetime. If not, the application will send the user to
 the IdP to login again, hoping for a longer lived assertion.
 SSP's default assertion lifetime is 5 minutes while SharePoint, by default, wants 10 minutes.
 Use the `assertion.lifetime` in `adfs-sp-remote.php` to set the time greater than that set in SharePoint
 (which can be configured by adjusting `LogonTokenCacheExpirationWindow`)
